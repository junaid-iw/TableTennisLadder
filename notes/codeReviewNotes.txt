# While loop doesn;t need finished (in add players)
#     Use break where necessary instead of finish
# Return two things

# addplayers - take another PlayerQuery out of if else
When mutating list, make it a separate function (core business function) (addplayers)

# anotherPlayerQuery - return True or False, if inavlid, reutnr false aswell
#     abstract further to y/n question

If winner not in players - nstead, generic method is player in certain list
# promptUserToInputPlayer("winner")
# rankings = getUpdatedRankings

# Consolidate updateranking in to one function which checkes if they're in or not, blah blah

seeRankings change to position, __ in enumerate(blah, start=1)

# quitProgram - take file writing out
